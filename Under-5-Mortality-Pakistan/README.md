# 🧒 Under-5 Mortality in Pakistan – Data Analysis Project

## 📊 Project Overview
This project analyzes the **Under-5 Mortality Rate in Pakistan** using health and demographic data from global development databases. The goal is to uncover patterns and trends to understand the key factors contributing to child mortality in the country.

## 🔧 Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Data Cleaning and Visualization

---

## 📂 Data Source
- UNICEF & World Bank datasets
- CSV data downloaded from [data.un.org](https://data.un.org/) and [data.worldbank.org](https://data.worldbank.org)

## 📌 Project Steps

1. **Data Cleaning**
   - Handled missing values and inconsistencies
   - Standardized country and year formats

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**
   - Trends in mortality rate (1950–2020)
   - Region-wise comparison
   - Correlation with health spending, education, etc.

3. **Visualization**
   - Line graphs to show time trends
   - Heatmaps for correlation
   - Bar charts by province/region (if available)

## 📈 Key Findings

- Significant decline in mortality after 1990s due to public health efforts
- Strong correlation between **maternal education** and reduced child mortality
- Gaps still exist in rural vs urban regions
